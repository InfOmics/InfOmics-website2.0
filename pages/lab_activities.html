          <h3>TUBE</h3>
          <div>There is an urgent need to understand the interplay of pollutants with 
            adverse effects in the brain, in order to steer political decision making 
            for efficient reduction of air pollutants. This could, in the long run, 
            reduce the economic burden caused by diseases associated with them. To 
            address this unmet need, the TUBE-project unites interdisciplinary expertise 
            to study these adverse effects of extremely fine particles (UFP’s) in the 
            human lung and brain. Leaning on this interdisciplinary approach and state 
            of the art research methodologies, TUBE will aim to discover the harmful 
            components of air pollution and identify biomarkers for early detection 
            of brain disease related to air pollution. This could improve brain health, 
            reduce the prevalence of brain diseases, provide significant economical 
            savings, and provide data that will be used to support planning future 
            traffic policy across the EU. <a href="https://www.tube-project.eu/" target="_blank">Read more.</a></div>

          <h3>ADAIR</h3>
          <div>
            ADAIR applies a precision medicine approach to stratify individuals to 
            subgroups for risk estimation and future AD prevention, ultimately aiming 
            to target air pollution induced effects in those individualsthat can most 
            benefit from them. The project investigates the novel, ambitious hypothesis 
            that the pollutant exposure environment of an individual alters cellular 
            mechanisms and functions, resulting in the expression of measurable biomarkers. 
            By identifying biomarkers, the individuals with increased AD risk can be 
            stratified prior to the disease onset and preventive measures can be 
            targeted to the specific at-risk populations in order to be most effective.<br>
            The main objectives are to:
          <ul>
            <li>Discover biomarkers of air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Correlate biomarkers to AD risk to identify sub-groups of 
            individuals with an increased susceptibility for air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Better understand how the exposure environment is linked with complex 
            disease mechanisms underlying AD, thus paving the way for future 
            therapeutic approaches.</li>

          <div>The University of Eastern Finland has received EU funding to recruit 
            14 doctoral students into a four-year multidisciplinary Neuro-Innovation 
            PhD programme, which will be implemented on the Kuopio campus. The University
            of Verona and Infomics research group are partners of the neuro-innovation PhD programme.
            The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Cofund grant of 1,5 million euros will 
            increase the scope and quality of multidisciplinary research in the 
            UEF Neuroscience Research Community (NEURO). Thereby, it will also 
            generate a strong positive impact on health innovation in Finland and beyond.
            The recruitment of the international PhD students will start in June 2021.

          <h3>AIRDEGEN 2021</h3>
          <div>Despite decades of neurodegenerative disease (ND) research, the 
            real molecular pathophysiology of the disease is still poorly 
            understood, and treatments remain inadequate. Remarkably little attention 
            is paid to the involvement of environmental factors, which are known 
            from epidemiological studies to strongly impact ND development. Air 
            pollution, a massive public health issue known to pose a major threat 
            to human health, is an important, ever-increasing global concern. A 
            growing body of evidence from epidemiological and controlled animal 
            studies shows that exposure to air pollutants also impairs the brain. 
            Furthermore, living in highly polluted areas is associated with 
            exacerbated cognitive dysfunction and ND. Many questions remain 
            unanswered as mechanistic information on air pollutant effects on 
            the brain is scarce. Importantly, biomarkers for air pollution and 
            ND risk prediction do not currently exist, thus hindering the 
            identification and stratification of individuals at risk for harmful 
            air pollution effects. <br>
            This workshop aims to investigate the novel, ambitious hypothesis that 
            the pollutant exposure environment of an individual alters cellular 
            mechanisms and functions, resulting in the expression of measurable 
            biomarkers. By identifying biomarkers, the individuals with increased 
            ND risk can be stratified prior to the disease onset and preventive 
            measures can be targeted to the specific at-risk populations in order 
            to be most effective. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/airdegen/home"

          <h3>MODIMO 2021</h3>
          <div>Multi-omics analysis aims at extracting previously uncovered biological 
            knowledge by integrating information across multiple single-omic sources. 
            Past approaches have focused on the simultaneous analysis of a small 
            number of omic data sets. Current challenges face the problem of integrating 
            multiple omic sources into a unified complex model, or of combining 
            already available tools for two-by-two omics analyses and merging their 
            outcomes. By doing so and leveraging integrated system-level knowledge, 
            multi-omic approaches ought to enable the development of better qualitative 
            and quantitative models for descriptive and predictive analyses. To 
            move this area forward, new statistical and algorithmic frameworks are 
            needed, for example for generalizing classical graph theory results to 
            heterogeneous networks, and applying them to diverse problems such as 
            drug repurposing or understanding the immune response to infections. Thus, 
            in short, this workshop aims at investigating novel methodologies for 
            providing crucial insights into multi-omics data management, integration, 
            and analysis in order to enable biological discoveries.

          <h3>Biomarker detection in Cancer</h3>
          <div>This Research Topic aims to explore recent advances in computational 
            techniques used to harness large-scale cancer genomic and clinical data 
            for biomarker detection or precision therapeutic strategies. At the 
            same time, our goal is keeping the focus on clinical relevance and 
            attempting to bridge the gap between computational and clinical research. 
            Computational approaches used for biomarker detection, therapeutic 
            response prediction, drug repurposing, and identifying effective drug 
            combination therapies will be discussed within this topic. Particularly, 
            detection of cancer patients with aggressive vs non-aggressive phenotypes, 
            or patients who may benefit from certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies, 
            using molecular markers will be of interest.
