          <h3>TUBE</h3>
          <div>There is an urgent need to understand the interplay of pollutants with 
            adverse effects in the brain, in order to steer political decision making 
            for efficient reduction of air pollutants. This could, in the long run, 
            reduce the economic burden caused by diseases associated with them. To 
            address this unmet need, the TUBE-project unites interdisciplinary expertise 
            to study these adverse effects of extremely fine particles (UFP’s) in the 
            human lung and brain. Leaning on this interdisciplinary approach and state 
            of the art research methodologies, TUBE will aim to discover the harmful 
            components of air pollution and identify biomarkers for early detection 
            of brain disease related to air pollution. This could improve brain health, 
            reduce the prevalence of brain diseases, provide significant economical 
            savings, and provide data that will be used to support planning future 
            traffic policy across the EU. <a href="https://www.tube-project.eu/" target="_blank">Read more.</a></div>

          <h3>ADAIR</h3>
          <div>
            ADAIR applies a precision medicine approach to stratify individuals to 
            subgroups for risk estimation and future AD prevention, ultimately aiming 
            to target air pollution induced effects in those individualsthat can most 
            benefit from them. The project investigates the novel, ambitious hypothesis 
            that the pollutant exposure environment of an individual alters cellular 
            mechanisms and functions, resulting in the expression of measurable biomarkers. 
            By identifying biomarkers, the individuals with increased AD risk can be 
            stratified prior to the disease onset and preventive measures can be 
            targeted to the specific at-risk populations in order to be most effective.<br>
            The main objectives are to:
          <ul>
            <li>Discover biomarkers of air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Correlate biomarkers to AD risk to identify sub-groups of 
            individuals with an increased susceptibility for air pollutant effects.</li>
            <li>Better understand how the exposure environment is linked with complex 
            disease mechanisms underlying AD, thus paving the way for future 
            therapeutic approaches.</li>

          <h3>AIRDEGEN 2021</h3>
          <div>Despite decades of neurodegenerative disease (ND) research, the 
            real molecular pathophysiology of the disease is still poorly 
            understood, and treatments remain inadequate. Remarkably little attention 
            is paid to the involvement of environmental factors, which are known 
            from epidemiological studies to strongly impact ND development. Air 
            pollution, a massive public health issue known to pose a major threat 
            to human health, is an important, ever-increasing global concern. A 
            growing body of evidence from epidemiological and controlled animal 
            studies shows that exposure to air pollutants also impairs the brain. 
            Furthermore, living in highly polluted areas is associated with 
            exacerbated cognitive dysfunction and ND. Many questions remain 
            unanswered as mechanistic information on air pollutant effects on 
            the brain is scarce. Importantly, biomarkers for air pollution and 
            ND risk prediction do not currently exist, thus hindering the 
            identification and stratification of individuals at risk for harmful 
            air pollution effects. <br>
            This workshop aims to investigate the novel, ambitious hypothesis that 
            the pollutant exposure environment of an individual alters cellular 
            mechanisms and functions, resulting in the expression of measurable 
            biomarkers. By identifying biomarkers, the individuals with increased 
            ND risk can be stratified prior to the disease onset and preventive 
            measures can be targeted to the specific at-risk populations in order 
            to be most effective. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/airdegen/home"

          <div>Multi-omics analysis aims at extracting previously uncovered biological 
            knowledge by integrating information across multiple single-omic sources. 
            Past approaches have focused on the simultaneous analysis of a small 
            number of omic data sets. Current challenges face the problem of integrating 
            multiple omic sources into a unified complex model, or of combining 
            already available tools for two-by-two omics analyses and merging their 
            outcomes. By doing so and leveraging integrated system-level knowledge, 
            multi-omic approaches ought to enable the development of better qualitative 
            and quantitative models for descriptive and predictive analyses. To 
            move this area forward, new statistical and algorithmic frameworks are 
            needed, for example for generalizing classical graph theory results to 
            heterogeneous networks, and applying them to diverse problems such as 
            drug repurposing or understanding the immune response to infections. Thus, 
            in short, this workshop aims at investigating novel methodologies for 
            providing crucial insights into multi-omics data management, integration, 
            and analysis in order to enable biological discoveries.

          <h3>ICHI 2021</h3>
          <div>Imaging genetics is an emerging longitudinal research field bridging 
            genetic insights to complex neurological diseases, exploiting quantitative
            brain imaging phenotypes. Imaging genetics primarly focus on identifying
            and characterizing how genic expression and genomic variation affect
            neuroanatomical and neurophysiological traits, by exploiting brain images
            information. Until now, have been proposed several imaging genetics methods 
            to investigate and improve our knowledge on different complex diseases, such
            as Alzheimer's disease, but only few works focused on Parkinson's Disease 
            (PD). Using PD as study case, our lab members Guglielmo Cerri, Rosalba Giugno 
            and Manuel Tognon will showcase a tutorial on imaging genetics during ICHI 2021,
            guiding the attendents through the different steps of the analysis. Moreover,
            they will also present an innovative multi-view imaging genetics workflow, 
            which exploits the advantages of existing methods to analyze heterogenous data, 
            such as genotyping, transcriptomic, and neuromorphological and functional brain 
            images. During the tuorial will be presented the main aspects of imaging 
            genetics analyses, moving from classical quality control to more techinical steps
            of the proposed method, such as GWAS, differential expression analysis and 
            functional annotation. The talk will take place on August 11th 2021 during ICHI 2021
            (held online). <a href="https://ichi2021.institute4hi.org/"

            for biomarker detection or precision therapeutic strategies. At the 
            same time, our goal is keeping the focus on clinical relevance and 
            attempting to bridge the gap between computational and clinical research. 
            Computational approaches used for biomarker detection, therapeutic 
            response prediction, drug repurposing, and identifying effective drug 
            combination therapies will be discussed within this topic. Particularly, 
            detection of cancer patients with aggressive vs non-aggressive phenotypes, 
            or patients who may benefit from certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies,

          <div>Vincenzo Bonnici is editor for the Special Issue "Information-Theoretical 
            Methods in Biological Systems". If life developed when biopolymers emerged to 
            efficiently represent, elaborate upon, and transmit information, we 
            cannot have a deep understanding of life without an application of 
            information theory. Investigations from this perspective, in the 
            general setting of the functional and evolutionary nature of living systems, 
            are welcome in this Special Issue on Information-Theoretical Methods in Biological Systems.

          <div>Vincenzo Bonnici is editor for the Special Issue 
            "Energy-Aware Smart Systems in Healthcare".
            Energy-aware systems in health automation are emerging as a new and inter-disciplinary 
            research field. We are witnessing a rapid development of advanced application 
            (by using information, communications, automation, and networking technologies) 
            to realize smart control systems in several smart systems regarding healthcare. 
            Smart systems are critical in driving innovations in the field of medical technology, 
            as they provide the basis for information-based health maintenance, and for 
            guaranteeing an efficient management of medical data and information processes 
            (i.e., big data management in smart systems and smart networks). Moreover, the 
            integration of low-power micro-sensors and micro-actuators will provide a technological 
            healthcare for better treatment and caretaking of patients in the hospital and at home

          <h3>HTLab - Healthcare Technology Lab</h3>
          <div>HTLab (Healthcare Technology Lab) is an innovative startup founded 
            on November 6, 2019, owned by vEyes (virtual Eyes) - ONLUS. Despite 
            his young age, thanks to the skills, the laboratories, the infrastructures 
            and the network with the clinical and technological realities that revolve 
            around vEyes, HTLab has already been among the winners of the third open 
            call launched by the FLAME project (H2020, grant agreement no. 731677).
